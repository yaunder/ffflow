# FFFlow Plugin for Claude Code

**Plan, work, audit — at the level of rigor your project actually needs.**

FFFlow is a complete development lifecycle in a single Claude Code plugin. It scales from informal prose specs (L0) to full spec-driven development with mutation testing and RID traceability (L3). Same workflow at every level; what changes is the formality of the artifacts and strictness of the gates.

The plugin's invocation prefix is `/fff:` — short, distinctive, won't collide.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/ffflow-plugin
/plugin install fff@ffflow
```

After install, every command is namespaced under `/fff:` (e.g., `/fff:plan-chat`, `/fff:work-issue`).

## The shape

Three artifacts. Three roles. Three locations.

- **Spec** (present tense, evergreen) — your codebase's behavioral contract. Lives in `docs/specs/`, `specs/`, or per-module CLAUDE.md.
- **Plan** (future tense, transient) — the path from current spec to next spec. Lives in `/tmp/ffflow-plans/<project-hash>/<slug>/`, never in the project tree.
- **Issues** (imperative, transactional) — the chess moves. Lives in your issue tracker.

## Workflows

**Bootstrap a new project (from `project.md`, README, or just an idea):**
```
/fff:adopt-ffflow   Detects greenfield vs. brownfield. Runs init + stack setup,
                    then hands off to /fff:plan-roadmap.
/fff:plan-roadmap   Reads your vision; produces ordered phases with dependencies.
                    Per phase: design-slice (→ plan-chat), characterize, cleanup,
                    or recursive sub-roadmap.
```

**Steady-state feature work (after bootstrap):**
```
/fff:plan-chat        Design one slice. Open decisions resolved inline before sealing.
/fff:plan-breakdown   Cut the plan into 3–8 independently shippable chess moves.
/fff:plan-capture     Write the chess moves to your issue tracker.
/fff:work-issue       Execute one chess move end-to-end: red → green → spec → PR.
/fff:work-fanout      Or run several in parallel across worktrees (one PR per issue).
/fff:work-epic        Or run an epic's issues sequentially into one PR.
/fff:audit            Periodically: check that specs, CLAUDE.md, tests still match reality.
```

**Maintenance loop:**
```
/fff:audit            Find drift. Find gaps.
/fff:audit --plan     Convert findings into a plan. Then breakdown → capture → work.
/fff:upgrade-ffflow   After updating the plugin: catch this repo up to the new version.
```

Updating the plugin changes what FFFlow *believes*; it doesn't change what your repo *contains*. `/fff:upgrade-ffflow` closes that gap — it reads the `ffflow_version` stamped in `.ffflow/config.yaml`, walks the migration ledger, and applies whatever your project is missing. Projects adopted before 0.4.0 have no stamp; the skill infers their effective version from what's actually in the tree, then stamps it so it never has to guess again.

## Two-tier planning

- **Tier 1** — `/fff:plan-roadmap` (phase-level). Used for new projects, big features, or new directions.
- **Tier 2** — three entries, each handling one phase:
  - `/fff:plan-chat` — design a slice.
  - `/fff:characterize` — extract specs from existing code.
  - `/fff:audit --plan` — convert drift into a plan.

All four converge on `plan-breakdown → plan-capture → work-*`.

Single-slice changes skip tier 1; bug fixes go through `plan-chat` directly.

## The L0–L3 dial

Pick the level your project needs. You can change levels later.

| Level | Spec format | Tests | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | Informal prose | Standard unit/integration | Lint + tests pass |
| **L1** | Structured prose, hexagonal layering | + defect-driven spec entries | + CLAUDE.md audit |
| **L2** | Gherkin 6 scenarios | + spec-first TDD | + spec audit, contract enforcement |
| **L3** | Gherkin + RIDs + property-based | + mutation testing | + four quality gates, RID audit |

No config = L0. Declare your level in `.ffflow/config.yaml` to enable more.

## Cartridge architecture

Several skills carry their family of variants as on-demand cartridges, keeping the LLM's skill index uncluttered:

- `/fff:plan-capture` — cartridges for `github-issues` (default), `linear`, `jira`, `markdown`.
- `/fff:stack` — cartridges for `python`, `typescript`, `java`, `rust`, `polyglot`.
- `/fff:justfile` — Tier 1–4 pattern cartridges (quality, security, advanced, polyglot).
- `/fff:audit` — cartridges for `claude-md`, `spec`, `char-tests`, `architecture`, `refactor`, `tech-debt`, `rid`.

Configure once in `.ffflow/config.yaml`; the right cartridge loads when needed.

## What FFFlow doesn't do

- It doesn't lock you to one stack. Pluggable via cartridges; override any tool via `.ffflow/stack.yaml`.
- It doesn't lock you to GitHub. Capture backends are pluggable (Linear, Jira, markdown).
- It doesn't replace your tests. Spec tests are additive — both unit and spec tests have independent coverage thresholds.
- It doesn't force L3 on you. L0 is a valid forever-state for projects that want lightweight discipline.

Contributions welcome. New stack cartridges (Go, Elixir, …), capture backends, and audit cartridges are the easiest ways to extend FFFlow without touching the core.

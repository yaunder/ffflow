# Migration ledger

The machine-readable half of [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md). `/fff:upgrade-ffflow` reads **this** file, not the changelog.

## What belongs here

Only **repo-affecting** changes: releases that change what a project's own files should look like. A change is repo-affecting if, after upgrading the plugin, an existing project would be *wrong* or *incomplete* until something in it changes.

| Change | Repo-affecting? |
|---|---|
| New skill that reads existing artifacts | ❌ — nothing in the repo needs to change |
| New invariant that requires a new artifact | ✅ |
| New config field | ✅ |
| Changed default template | ✅ (existing generated files now differ from the template) |
| Bug fix in a skill's own logic | ❌ |
| New stack cartridge | ❌ (opt-in; only affects projects that choose it) |
| Renamed config field / skill / recipe | ✅ (and it's a major bump) |

When in doubt, ask: *"If I upgrade the plugin and change nothing in my repo, is my repo now inconsistent with FFFlow?"* Yes → it needs an entry.

## Entry schema

Each entry is one repo-affecting change. Entries are ordered oldest-first within a version, and versions oldest-first in the file.

```yaml
- id: example-entry-id                 # stable, unique across all versions; never reused or renamed
  version: 0.4.0                       # version that introduced the change
  title: Human-readable one-liner
  applies_when: always                 # always | a condition on .ffflow/config.yaml or repo state
  severity: high                       # high | medium | low — drives ordering and default selection
  detect: |                            # how to tell if this repo ALREADY has the change
    Prose or shell describing the check. MUST be decidable by reading the repo,
    never by trusting the version stamp.
  remediate: |                         # what to do when detect says "missing"
    What upgrade-ffflow should do. Delegate to an existing skill wherever one owns the artifact.
  autonomous: true                     # safe to apply without asking? (false → always confirm)
```

**`detect` must never consult `ffflow_version`.** The stamp is a hint for ordering and reporting; detection is always evidence-based against the repo itself. That is what makes duck-typing an unstamped repo work, and what makes the ledger self-correcting when a repo was hand-edited.

## Ledger

### 0.1.0 — initial release

```yaml
- id: ffflow-config
  version: 0.1.0
  title: .ffflow/config.yaml exists
  applies_when: always
  severity: high
  detect: |
    `.ffflow/config.yaml` exists and parses as YAML with a `level:` key.
  remediate: |
    The project is not on FFFlow at all. Do not upgrade — stop and direct the
    user to `/fff:adopt-ffflow`. upgrade-ffflow reconciles adopted projects;
    it does not adopt them.
  autonomous: false
```

### 0.2.0 — specdrive is language-agnostic

```yaml
- id: l3-unlocked-all-stacks
  version: 0.2.0
  title: L3 available on Python / Java / Rust
  applies_when: config.stack in [python, java, rust, polyglot]
  severity: low
  detect: |
    Nothing in the repo records the old cap, so this is an informational entry
    rather than a remediation. Consider it "present" if config.level is already
    L3, or if the user has never expressed interest in raising the level.
  remediate: |
    Inform only — do not change the level. Tell the user that L3 is available on
    their stack (it was incorrectly capped at L2 before 0.2.0) and that raising it
    is a deliberate methodology choice made via `/fff:init-ffflow`.
  autonomous: true
```

### 0.2.1 — per-language justfile cartridges

```yaml
- id: justfile-baseline-recipes
  version: 0.2.1
  title: Justfile implements the baseline recipe set
  applies_when: a justfile exists at the project root
  severity: medium
  detect: |
    The root `justfile` defines the baseline recipes named in the `justfile`
    skill (test, lint, format, check-all, and the stack's own additions).
    Missing recipes = gap. No justfile at all = not applicable (the project
    opted out; do not install one during an upgrade).
  remediate: |
    Delegate to `/fff:stack-init`, which owns justfile generation and is
    idempotent and non-destructive. Report which recipes were missing.
  autonomous: false
```

### 0.3.0 — view-layer purity

```yaml
- id: ui-view-layer-purity
  version: 0.3.0
  title: View-layer-purity structure adopted for UI projects
  applies_when: config.stack == typescript-ui, OR repo has UI signals (react, react-dom, lit, @awesome.me/webawesome, vue, svelte, @storybook/*, .storybook/)
  severity: medium
  detect: |
    Three things together: (1) `.ffflow/stack.yaml` sets `extends: typescript-ui`
    with a `ui_baseline` dimension; (2) a `.storybook/` directory exists;
    (3) a design-token layer exists. Any missing = gap.

    A project with UI signals but `stack: typescript` (not `typescript-ui`) is
    the common pre-0.3.0 shape — flag it, since switching stacks is a
    methodology decision the user must make.
  remediate: |
    Delegate to `/fff:adopt-ffflow --ui` (optionally `--lane react|web-components`),
    which is the purpose-built retrofit verb for exactly this migration.
  autonomous: false
```

### 0.4.0 — beliefs, hierarchy, and version stamping

```yaml
- id: version-stamp
  version: 0.4.0
  title: .ffflow/config.yaml carries ffflow_version
  applies_when: always
  severity: high
  detect: |
    `.ffflow/config.yaml` has an `ffflow_version:` key.
  remediate: |
    Write `ffflow_version` and `ffflow_upgraded`. This is the LAST step of any
    upgrade run — never stamp before the other remediations have been applied or
    explicitly declined, or the repo claims a version it hasn't reached.
  autonomous: true

- id: beliefs-block
  version: 0.4.0
  title: Managed beliefs block in root CLAUDE.md
  applies_when: always
  severity: high
  detect: |
    Root `CLAUDE.md` contains a matched pair of `<!-- ffflow:beliefs ... -->` and
    `<!-- ffflow:beliefs end -->` markers. If present, compare the version in the
    opening marker to the current plugin version — older = stale, needs refresh.
    An unmatched or malformed marker pair is a gap, not an error: rewrite it whole.
  remediate: |
    Write or refresh the block per the canonical text in the `init-ffflow` skill.
    Replace ONLY the bytes between the markers. If no markers exist, insert the
    block after the root file's opening purpose/overview section and before the
    first deep-detail section — high enough to be read, not so high it displaces
    the file's own introduction.
  autonomous: true

- id: hierarchical-claude-md
  version: 0.4.0
  title: Significant modules carry their own CLAUDE.md
  applies_when: always
  severity: high
  detect: |
    Run the `claude-md` audit cartridge's coverage scan (§1 of that cartridge).
    Any significant directory without a CLAUDE.md is a gap. Reuse the cartridge's
    significance criteria verbatim — do not reimplement them here.
  remediate: |
    Do NOT generate the files here. Delegate to
    `/fff:audit --type claude-md --fix`, which owns CLAUDE.md coverage,
    templates, and generation. Report the gap count and hand off.

    This entry is the reason 0.4.0 exists: a repo can be years into FFFlow and
    still have exactly one CLAUDE.md, because coverage was only ever an audit
    finding and never a stated belief.
  autonomous: false

- id: uncommit-session-notes
  version: 0.4.0
  title: Session notes and decision logs are not committed
  applies_when: always
  severity: high
  detect: |
    Any of these tracked by git (`git ls-files`):
      - `.ffflow/notes/**`
      - a `notetoself-*.md` anywhere in the tree
      - a decision log written by `/fff:autopilot --decision-log` to a repo path
    Tracked = gap. Present-but-gitignored = fine, that's the intended end state.
  remediate: |
    For each tracked file: `git rm --cached <path>` (keep the working copy —
    it's someone's session state and may still be in use), then add the pattern
    to `.gitignore`.

    Before removing, SHOW the user the file list and ask. A note may contain
    content that belongs to the project — if so, promote that content into the
    spec, an issue, or a module CLAUDE.md first, then untrack the note.

    Never delete the working copy, and never untrack without confirmation:
    someone may be mid-handoff.

    Cause: pre-0.4.0 `notetoself` advised copying notes into `.ffflow/notes/`
    for durability past /tmp cleanup, contradicting its own state table. That
    advice is gone; this entry cleans up after it.
  autonomous: false

- id: root-conventions-hierarchy
  version: 0.4.0
  title: Root CLAUDE.md Conventions block names the hierarchy rule
  applies_when: root CLAUDE.md has a Conventions section
  severity: low
  detect: |
    The Conventions section mentions per-module / hierarchical CLAUDE.md.
    Largely subsumed by `beliefs-block` — this entry catches projects whose
    Conventions section is hand-maintained outside the managed markers.
  remediate: |
    Suggest (do not auto-write) adding a hierarchy bullet to the human-owned
    Conventions section, or point out that the beliefs block already covers it
    and the Conventions duplicate can be trimmed.
  autonomous: false
```
